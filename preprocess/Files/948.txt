
Predict the output of below program


int main()
{
 char *ptr = "geeksforgeeks";
 printf("%c\n", *&*&*ptr);
 
 getchar();
 return 0;
}

Output: g
Explanation:  The operator * is used for dereferencing and the operator & is used to get the address.  These operators cancel effect of each other when used one after another. We can apply them alternatively any no. of times.  For example *ptr gives us g,  &*ptr gives address of g, *&*ptr again g, &*&*ptr address of g, and finally *&*&*ptr gives ‘g’
Now try below

int main()
{
 char *ptr = "geeksforgeeks";
 printf("%s\n", *&*&ptr);
 
 getchar();
 return 0;
}
