Algorithm

1. Enter the whole string into stringstream.
2. Empty the string.
3. Extract word by word and concatenate to the string.

Read about stringstream here

// C++ program to remove spaces using stringstream
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

/* Function to remove spaces */
string removeSpaces(string str)
{
    stringstream ss;
    string temp;

    /* Storing the whole string into string stream */
    ss << str;

    /* Making the string empty */
    str = "";

    /* Running loop till end of stream */
    while (!ss.eof())
    {
        /* extracting word by word from stream */
        ss >> temp;

        /* concatenating in the string to be
          returned*/
        str = str + temp;
    }
    return str;
}

/*Driver function */
int main()
{
    string s = "This is a test";
    cout << removeSpaces(s) << endl;

    s = "geeks for geeks";
    cout << removeSpaces(s) << endl;

    s = "geeks quiz is awsome!";
    cout << removeSpaces(s) << endl;

    s = "I   love     to     code";
    cout << removeSpaces(s) << endl;

    return 0;
}

Output:

Thisisatest
geeksforgeeks
geeksquizisawsome!
