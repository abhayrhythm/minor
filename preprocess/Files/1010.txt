
Following questions have been asked in GATE CS exam. 
1. Consider the following C program segment:

char p[20];
char *s = "string";
int length = strlen(s);
int i;
for (i = 0; i < length; i++)
     p[i] = s[length — i];
printf("%s",p);

The output of the program is (GATE CS 2004)
a)	gnirts
b)	gnirt
c)	string
d)	no output is printed
Answer(d)
Let us consider below line inside the for loop
     p[i] = s[length — i];
For i = 0, p[i] will be s[6 — 0] and s[6] is ‘\0′
So p[0] becomes ‘\0’.  It doesn’t matter what comes in p[1], p[2]….. as P[0] will not change for i >0. Nothing is printed if we print a string with first character ‘\0′
