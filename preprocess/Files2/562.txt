let us solv classic fake coin puzzl use decis tree 
two differ variant puzzl given 
provid descript puzzl tri solv assum n 8 easi given two pan fair balanc n ident look coin one coin lighter heavier 
figur odd coin mani minimum number weigh requir worst case 
difficult given two pan fair balanc n ident look coin one coin may defect 
trace coin odd one also determin whether lighter heavier minimum number trial worst case 
let us start rel simpl exampl 
read everi problem tri solv 
problem 1 easi given 5 coin one coin lighter 
worst case mani minimum number weigh requir figur odd coin 
name coin 1 2 3 4 5 know one coin lighter 
consid best come balanc group coin two differ way 1 2 3 4 5 12 34 5 
easili rule group like 123 45 get obviou answer 
combin fall one two group like 2 45 13 etc 
consid first group pair 1 2 3 4 
check 1 2 equal go ahead 3 4 
need two weigh worst case 
analog appli coin heavier 
second group weigh 12 34 
balanc 5 defect one otherwis pick lighter pair need one weigh find odd one 
combin need two weigh case 5 coin prior inform one coin lighter 
analysi gener know coin heavi light trace coin log3 n trial round next integ 
repres outcom balanc ternari tree everi leaf repres outcom 
sinc coin among n coin defect need get 3 ari tree minimum n leav 
3 ari tree k th level 3k leav henc need 3k n word k trial examin upto 3k coin know whether defect coin heavier lighter 
given coin heavier verifi 3 trial suffici find odd coin among 12 coin 32 12 33 problem 2 difficult given 4 coin one coin may defect 
know whether coin genuin defect one present 
mani number weigh requir worst case figur odd coin present 
also need tell whether heavier lighter 
analysi may think k 2 trial suffici sinc two level 3 ari tree yield 9 leav greater n 4 read problem 
note imposs solv 4 coin problem two weigh 
decis tree confirm fact tri draw 
group coin two differ way 12 34 1 2 3 4 
let us consid combin 12 34 correspond decis tree given 
blue leav valid outcom red leav imposs case 
arriv imposs case due assumpt made earlier path 
outcom 12 34 e 
go left subtre 12 34 e 
go right subtre 
left subtre possibl two way either 1 2 lighter b either 3 4 heavier 
left subtre second trial weigh 1 2 3 4 
let us consid 3 4 analog 1 2 similar 
outcom second trail three way 3 4 yield 4 defect heavier coin b 3 4 yield 3 defect heavier coin c 3 4 yield ambigu 
need one weigh check genuin coin 1 2 figur took 3 2 3 confirm genuin 
get 3 2 2 lighter 3 2 1 lighter 
note imposs get 3 2 contradict assumpt lean left side 
similarli analyz right subtre 
need two weigh right subtre well 
overal need 3 weigh trace odd coin 
note unabl util two outcom 3 ari tree 
also tree full tree middl branch termin first weigh 
infact get 27 leav 3 level full 3 ari tree got 11 leav includ imposs case 
analysi given n coin may genuin one coin defect 
need decis tree atleast 2n 1 leav correspond output 
n leav lighter n leav heavier one genuin case total 2n 1 leav 
explain earlier ternari tree level k utmost 3k leav need tree leav 3k 2n 1 
word need atleast k log3 2n 1 weigh find defect one 
observ figur branch gener leav e 
miss valid output branch lead number trial 
possibl group coin way everi branch go yield valid output simpl term gener full 3 ari tree 
problem 4 describ approach 12 coin 
problem 3 special case two pan balanc given 5 coin group 4 coin one coin defect know whether heavier lighter one coin genuin 
mani weigh requir worst case figur odd coin whether heavier lighter 
label coin 1 2 3 4 g genuin

left side tree correspond case g1 23 
possibl two way either 1 lighter either 2 3 heavier 
former instanc obviou next weigh 2 3 balanc yield 1 lighter 
later instanc could 2 3 yield 3 heavier 2 3 yield 2 heavier 
leaf node left branch name reflect outcom 
right side tree correspond case g1 23 
possibl two way either 1 heavier either 2 3 lighter 
former instanc obviou next weigh 2 3 balanc yield 1 heavier 
later case could 2 3 yield 2 lighter coin 2 3 yield 3 lighter 
problem possibl need two weigh

find odd coin minimum trial also determin whether defect coin lighter heavier worst case 
want group

rememb group coin first weigh reveal atleast one genuin coin 
let us name coin 1 2 8 b c combin coin 3 group name 1234 5678 abcd

also know set coin lighter set coin heavier 
need shuffl weigh two group way end smaller height decis tree 
consid second outcom 1234 5678

let us shuffl coin 1235 4bcd new group differ shuffl possibl also lead minimum weigh tri 
weigh two group outcom three way 1235 4bcd yield one among 1 2 3 lighter similar problem 1 explain need one weigh ii 1235 4bcd yield one among 6 7 8 heavier similar problem 1 explain need one weigh iii 1235 4bcd yield either 5 heavier coin 4 lighter coin expens one weigh
