Some data types like char , short int  take less number of bytes than int, these data types are automatically promoted to int or unsigned int when an operation is performed on them. This is called integer promotion. For example no arithmetic calculation happens on smaller types like char, short and enum.  They are first converted to int or unsigned int, and then arithmetic is done on them.  If an int can represent all values of the original type, the value is converted to an int
