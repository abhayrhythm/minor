
Write a C++ program that prints “GeeksforGeeks” with empty main() function.  You are not allowed to write anything in main().
One way of doing this is to apply constructor attribute to a function so that it executes before main() (See this for details).

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/* Apply the constructor attribute to myStartupFun() so that it
   is executed before main() */
void myStartupFun (void) __attribute__ ((constructor));

/* implementation of myStartupFun */
void myStartupFun (void)
{
    cout << "GeeksforGeeks";
}

int main ()
{

}

Output:
GeeksforGeeks
The above approach would work only with GCC family of compilers.  Following is an interesting way of doing it in C++.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass
{
public:
    MyClass()
    {
        cout << "GeeksforGeeks";
    }
}m;

int main()
{

}

Output:
GeeksforGeeks
The idea is to create a class, have a cout statement in constructor and create a global object of the class.  When the object is created, constructor is called and “GeeksforGeeks” is printed.
