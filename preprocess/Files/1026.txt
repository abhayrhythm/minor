
Predict the output of the below programs. 
Question 1

int main()
{
 int c=5;
 printf("%d\n%d\n%d", c, c <<= 2, c >>= 2);
 getchar();
}

Output: Compiler dependent
Evaluation order of parameters is not defined by C standard and is dependent on compiler implementation. It is never safe to depend on the order of parameter evaluation. For example, a function call like above may very well behave differently from one compiler to another.
