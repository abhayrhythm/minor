An undirected graph is called Biconnected if there are two vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices.  In a Biconnected Graph, there is a simple cycle through any two vertices.
By convention, two nodes connected by an edge form a biconnected graph, but this does not verify the above properties. For a graph with more than two vertices, the above properties must be there for it to be Biconnected.
Following are some examples.
