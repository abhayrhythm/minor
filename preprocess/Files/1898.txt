
This is simple, but interesting programming  puzzle. Given three integers, low, high and x such that high >= low. How to check if x lies in range [low, high] or not using single comparison. For example, if range is [10, 100] and number is 30, then output is true and if the number is 5, then output is false for same range.  
A simple solution is compare x with low and high

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Returns true if x is in range [low..high], else false
bool inRange(unsigned low, unsigned high, unsigned x)
{
    return (low <= x  && x <= high);
}

int main()
{
    inRange(10, 100, 30)? cout << "Yes\n":  cout  <<"No\n";
    inRange(10, 100, 5)?  cout << "Yes\n":  cout  <<"No\n";
}

Output:
Yes
No


  The above solution does two comparisons, 
  Can we do the same task using one comparison?
