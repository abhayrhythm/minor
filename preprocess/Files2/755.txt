speed boat still water b km hr speed stream km hr speed upstream b km hr speed downstream b km hr speed upstream u km hr speed downstream km hr speed boat still water 0 5 x u km hr speed stream 0 5 x u km hr sampl problem question 1 100 long train move speed 60 km hr pass man stand pavement near railway track 
find time taken train pass man 
solut length train 100 0 1 km speed train 60 km hr time taken train pass man time taken cover 0 1 km speed 60 km hr therefor time taken train pass man 0 1 60 hour 0 1 60 x 3600 sec 6 sec question 2 long train 1000 long move speed 90 km hr would take pass 500 long bridg 
solut time taken train pass bridg complet would time take cover 1000 500 1500 speed 90 km hr 90 x 5 18 25 sec 
therefor time requir 1500 25 60 sec 1 minut question 3 man stand near railway track observ train pass 80 second pass 180 long bridg train take 200 second 
find speed train 
solut let length train l meter 
train cover l meter 80 second l 180 meter 200 second speed 
know speed distanc time 
speed l 80 l 180 200 l 80 l 180 200 2 5 l l 180 1 5 l 180 l 120 thu speed train 120 80 1 5 sec question 4 two train 140 160 long move toward parallel track speed 40 km hr 50 km hr respect 
much time would take pass complet 
solut total distanc cover 140 160 300 rel speed 40 50 90 km hr 90 x 5 18 sec 25 sec therefor time taken pass 300 25 12 sec question 5 two train 140 160 long move direct parallel track speed 40 km hr 50 km hr respect 
much time would faster train requir overtak slower train 
solut total distanc cover 140 160 300 rel speed 50 40 10 km hr 10 x 5 18 sec 50 18 sec therefor time taken faster train overtak slower train 300 50 18 108 sec question 6 500 long train take 36 second cross man walk opposit direct speed 10 km hr 
find speed train 
solut let speed train km hr 
rel speed 10 km hr length train 500 0 5 km know distanc speed x time 0 5 10 x 36 3600 50 10 40 km hr therefor speed train 40 km hr 
question 7 non stop train start delhi toward mumbai time anoth non stop train start mumbai toward delhi 
meet bhopal took 9 16 hour respect reach destin find speed train start delhi given speed train start mumbai move speed 90 km hr 
solut know two train start time s1 s2 t21 2 t11 2 s2 90 km hr t1 9 hr t2 16 hr s1 90 4 3 s1 120 km hr therefor speed train start delhi 120 km hr question 8 boatman row boat upstream 14 km hr downstream 20 km hr 
find speed boat still water speed stream 
solut given speed downstream 20 km hr speed upstream u 14 km hr therefor speed boat still water 0 5 x u km hr 0 5 x 14 20 17 km hr also speed stream 0 5 x u km hr 0 5 x 20 14 3 km hr anoth method speed stream 0 5 x u 0 5 x 6 3 km hr speed boat still water speed stream speed upstream 3 14 17 km hr question 9 boatman row boat speed 5 km upstream 15 km downstream 
cover upstream need 2 5 hour cover downstream need 1 5 hour 
find speed stream speed boat still water 
solut given boatman cover 5 km upstream 2 5 hour 15 km downstream 10 hour 
speed upstream u 5 2 5 2 km hr speed downstream 15 1 5 10 km hr therefor speed boat still water 0 5 x u km hr 0 5 x 10 2 6 km hr also speed stream 0 5 x u km hr 0 5 x 10 2 4 km hr question 10 man go port island return 
row boat speed 7 km hr still water 
speed stream 2 km hr 
take 56 minut complet round trip find distanc port island 
solut speed upstream 7 2 5 km hr speed downstream 7 2 9 km hr let distanc port island km 
also know time distanc speed 5 9 56 60 14 45 56 60 3 km therefor distanc port island 3 km question 11 boat race person row boat 6 km upstream return start point 4 hour

also row 40 km upstream 55 km downstream 13 hour 
find speed boat still water speed stream 
solut let speed upstream u km hr speed downstream km hr 
know distanc speed time 30 u 44 10 40 u 55 13 solv pair linear equat get 11 km hr u 5 km hr therefor speed boat still water 0 5 x u km hr 0 5 x 11 5 8 km hr also speed stream 0 5 x u km hr 0 5 x 11 5 3 km hr articl contribut nishant arora pleas write comment doubt relat topic discuss face difficulti question would like discuss question mention
