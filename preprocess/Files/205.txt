
Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following.
1) Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(),  (())(), (()()).
2) Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
3) Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children)  with n+1 leaves.
See this for more applications. 
The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …
Recursive Solution
Catalan numbers satisfy the following recursive formula.

Following is the implementation of above recursive formula.

C++



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// A recursive function to find nth catalan number
unsigned long int catalan(unsigned int n)
{
    // Base case
    if (n <= 1) return 1;

    // catalan(n) is sum of catalan(i)*catalan(n-i-1)
    unsigned long int res = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        res += catalan(i)*catalan(n-i-1);

    return res;
}

// Driver program to test above function
int main()
{
    for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
        cout << catalan(i) << " ";
    return 0;
}
