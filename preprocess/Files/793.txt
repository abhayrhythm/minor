
Today we are going to discuss formatting files in the user’s workspace by their extension. For this we are going to make use of Clang’s format tools.
Prerequisites:

Linux Machine
Python
Clang Tool

Setup:

Install Python using the following command:
sudo apt-get install python

Install Clang Format Tools
sudo apt-get install clang-format-3.5



Create a python file named format-code.py at any location where you have read and write permissions. In this example we are going to create it in /home/user/. It shall contain the following code:

# Python program to format C/C++ files using clang-format
import os

# File Extension filter. You can add new extension
cpp_extensions = (".cxx",".cpp",".c", ".hxx", ".hh", ".cc", ".hpp")

# Set the current working directory for scanning c/c++ sources (including
# header files) and apply the clang formatting
# Please note "-style" is for standard style options
# and "-i" is in-place editing
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(os.getcwd()):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith(cpp_extensions):
            os.system("clang-format-3.5 -i -style=file " + root + "/" + file)


Create format specification file and copy it to project’s top level directory , e.g., /home/user/myproject/

Create formatting file (in example, we are creating google coding style tool)
clang-format-3.5 -style=google -dump-config > .clang-format 

Copy it to project’s directory i.e., it’s location becomes: /home/user/myproject/.clang-format



How to use it?

Navigate to the directory whose files you want to format, e.g.,
cd  /home/user/myproject/c-source/

Run the format-code file that you created earlier
python /home/user/format-code.py

This shall format all the files in our source directory with the extension same as that mentioned in the code.
