
In C++, delete operator should only be used either for the pointers pointing to the memory allocated using new operator or for a NULL pointer, and free() should only be used either for the pointers pointing to the memory allocated using malloc() or for a NULL pointer. 

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
    int x;
    int *ptr1 = &x;
    int *ptr2 = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    int *ptr3 = new int;
    int *ptr4 = NULL;

    /* delete Should NOT be used like below because x is allocated 
        on stack frame */
    delete ptr1;  

    /* delete Should NOT be used like below because x is allocated 
        using malloc() */
    delete ptr2;  

    /* Correct uses of delete */
    delete ptr3;
    delete ptr4;

    getchar();
    return 0;
}
