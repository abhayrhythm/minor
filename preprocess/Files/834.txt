
The idea is to provide a framework for students and instructor.  The framework provides an instructor-friendly remote monitoring of lab, effective evaluation, and grading methodology. The system also provides a student-friendly remote login, software access, and problem resolution through effective help from the teacher. The framework can be easily implemented as a client–server in Java.
Features:
Instructor Panel:
    a) Sees icons for all students.  Can click on an icon to see what student is doing.
    b) Can chat with students
    c) Can identify copying/opening windows other than IDE.  An icon blinks if there is a sudden change in picture.
Student Panel:
    a) Can send a help request to instructor.
    b) Can chat with instructor
Implementation:
We can capture screenshots of all students and send them at fixed intervals (say 2 seconds) to the instructor.
Tools:
Java provides rich libraries for networking and Image processing.   Java and Netbeans can be downloaded from below link:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Research:
a) Image compression techniques specialized for images that contains programming text.
b) Feature (c) mentioned in instructor panel is interesting.
