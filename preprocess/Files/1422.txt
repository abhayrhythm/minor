
Given a singly linked list and a key, count number of occurrences of given key in linked list.  For example, if given linked list is 1->2->1->2->1->3->1 and given key is 1, then output should be 4.

We strongly recommend that you click here and practice it, before moving on to the solution.

Algorithm: 

1. Initialize count as zero.
2. Loop through each element of linked list:
     a) If element data is equal to the passed number then
        increment the count.
3. Return count. 

Implementation:

C/C++



// C/C++ program to count occurrences in a linked list
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

/* Link list node */
struct node
{
    int data;
    struct node* next;
};

/* Given a reference (pointer to pointer) to the head
  of a list and an int, push a new node on the front
  of the list. */
void push(struct node** head_ref, int new_data)
{
    /* allocate node */
    struct node* new_node =
            (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));

    /* put in the data  */
    new_node->data  = new_data;

    /* link the old list off the new node */
    new_node->next = (*head_ref);

    /* move the head to point to the new node */
    (*head_ref)    = new_node;
}

/* Counts the no. of occurences of a node
   (search_for) in a linked list (head)*/
int count(struct node* head, int search_for)
{
    struct node* current = head;
    int count = 0;
    while (current != NULL)
    {
        if (current->data == search_for)
           count++;
        current = current->next;
    }
    return count;
}

/* Drier program to test count function*/
int main()
{
    /* Start with the empty list */
    struct node* head = NULL;

    /* Use push() to construct below list
     1->2->1->3->1  */
    push(&head, 1);
    push(&head, 3);
    push(&head, 1);
    push(&head, 2);
    push(&head, 1);

    /* Check the count function */
    printf("count of 1 is %d", count(head, 1));
    return 0;
