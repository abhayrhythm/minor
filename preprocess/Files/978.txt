Below are the solutions to get sum of the digits.  
1. Iterative:
The function has three lines instead of one line but it calculates sum in line.  It can be made one line function if we pass pointer to sum.

# include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int n = 687;
  printf(" %d ", getSum(n));

  getchar();
  return 0;
}

/* Function to get sum of digits */
int getSum(int n)
{
    int sum;
    /*Single line that calculates sum*/
    for(sum=0; n > 0; sum+=n%10,n/=10);
    return sum;
}
