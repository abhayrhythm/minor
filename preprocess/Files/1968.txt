
We have discussed a similar topic in Java here. Unlike Java, C++ allows to give more restrictive access to derived class methods.  For example the following program compiles fine. 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual int fun(int i) { }
};

class Derived: public Base {
private:
    int fun(int x)   {  }
};

int main()
{  }

In the above program, if we change main() to following, will get compiler error becuase fun() is private in derived class.

int main()
{
    Derived d;
    d.fun(1);
    return 0;
}
