
In C, data type of result of comparison operations is int.  For example, see the following program.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x = 10, y = 10;
    printf("%d \n", sizeof(x == y));
    printf("%d \n", sizeof(x < y));
    return 0;
}
Output:

Whereas in C++, type of results of comparison operations is bool. For example, see the following program.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x = 10, y = 10;
    cout << sizeof(x == y) << endl;
    cout << sizeof(x < y);
    return 0;
}

Output:
