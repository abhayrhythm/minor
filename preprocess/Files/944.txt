exit() terminates the process normally. 
status:  Status value returned to the parent process. Generally, a status value of 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS indicates success, and any other value or the constant EXIT_FAILURE is used to indicate an error. exit() performs following operations.

* Closes all open files.
* Removes temporary files.
* Returns an integer exit status to the operating system.
The C standard atexit() function can be used to customize exit() to perform additional actions at program termination.
