
Give a = 12 and b = 36 write a C function/macro that returns 3612 without using arithmetic, strings  and predefined functions.
We strongly recommend you to minimize your browser and try this yourself first.
Below is one solution that uses String Token-Pasting Operator (##) of C macros.  For example, the expression “a##b” prints concatenation of ‘a’ and ‘b’.  
Below is a working C code.

#include <stdio.h>
#define merge(a, b) b##a
int main(void)
{
    printf("%d ", merge(12, 36));
    return 0;
}

Output:
3612
