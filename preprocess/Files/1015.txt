1. What does the following program print? 

#include<stdio.h>
void f(int *p, int *q)
{
  p = q;
 *p = 2;
}
int i = 0, j = 1;
int main()
{
  f(&i, &j);
  printf("%d %d \n", i, j);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

(A) 2 2
(B) 2 1
(C) 0 1
(D) 0 2
Answer (D)
See below f() with comments for explanation.

/* p points to i and q points to j */
void f(int *p, int *q)
{
  p = q;    /* p also points to j now */
 *p = 2;   /* Value of j is changed to 2 now */
}
