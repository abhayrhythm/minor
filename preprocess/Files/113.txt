
Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change? 
Examples:

Input: coins[] = {25, 10, 5}, V = 30
Output: Minimum 2 coins required
We can use one coin of 25 cents and one of 5 cents 

Input: coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}, V = 11
Output: Minimum 2 coins required
We can use one coin of 6 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents

This problem is a variation of the problem discussed Coin Change Problem.  Here instead of finding total number of possible solutions, we need to find the solution with minimum number of coins.
The minimum number of coins for a value V can be computed using below recursive formula.

If V == 0, then 0 coins required.
If V > 0
   minCoin(coins[0..m-1], V) = min {1 + minCoins(V-coin[i])} 
                               where i varies from 0 to m-1 
                               and coin[i] <= V 
Below is recursive solution based on above recursive formula.

// A Naive recursive C++ program to find minimum of coins
// to make a given change V
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// m is size of coins array (number of different coins)
int minCoins(int coins[], int m, int V)
{
   // base case
   if (V == 0) return 0;

   // Initialize result
   int res = INT_MAX;

   // Try every coin that has smaller value than V
   for (int i=0; i<m; i++)
   {
     if (coins[i] <= V)
     {
         int sub_res = minCoins(coins, m, V-coins[i]);

         // Check for INT_MAX to avoid overflow and see if
         // result can minimized
         if (sub_res != INT_MAX && sub_res + 1 < res)
            res = sub_res + 1;
     }
   }
   return res;
}

// Driver program to test above function
int main()
{
    int coins[] =  {9, 6, 5, 1};
    int m = sizeof(coins)/sizeof(coins[0]);
    int V = 11;
    cout << "Minimum coins required is "
         << minCoins(coins, m, V);
    return 0;
