
Assume the structure of a Linked List node is as follows. 

struct node
{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
};

Explain the functionality of following C functions.
1. What does the following function do for a given Linked List?

void fun1(struct node* head)
{
  if(head == NULL)
    return;
 
  fun1(head->next);
  printf("%d  ", head->data);
}

fun1() prints the given Linked List in reverse manner. For Linked List 1->2->3->4->5, fun1() prints 5->4->3->2->1.
