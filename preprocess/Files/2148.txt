
Here is an implementation.  


#define my_sizeof(type) (char *)(&type+1)-(char*)(&type)
int main()
{
    double x;
    printf("%d", my_sizeof(x));
    getchar();
    return 0;
}

You can also implement using function instead of macro, but function implementation cannot be done in C as C doesn’t support function overloading and sizeof() is supposed to receive parameters of all data types. 
Note that above implementation assumes that size of character is one byte.  
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
