
Explain the functionality of below recursive functions.  
Question 1

void fun1(int n)
{
   int i = 0;  
   if (n > 1)
     fun1(n-1);
   for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
     printf(" * ");
}

Answer: Total numbers of stars printed is equal to 1 + 2 + â€¦. (n-2) + (n-1) + n, which is n(n+1)/2.
