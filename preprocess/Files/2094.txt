Consider the below program. 

void read()
{
   char str[20];
   gets(str);
   printf("%s", str);
   return;
}

The code looks simple, it reads string from standard input and prints the entered string, but it suffers from Buffer Overflow as gets() doesn’t do any array bound testing. gets() keeps on reading until it sees a newline character. 
To avoid Buffer Overflow, fgets() should be used instead of gets() as fgets() makes sure that not more than MAX_LIMIT characters are read.

#define MAX_LIMIT 20
void read()
{
   char str[MAX_LIMIT];
   fgets(str, MAX_LIMIT, stdin);
   printf("%s", str);

   getchar();
   return;
}
