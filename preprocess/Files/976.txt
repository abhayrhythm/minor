
What should be the  “condition” so that the following code  snippet  prints both HelloWorld !


      if  "condition"
          printf ("Hello");
      else
          printf("World"); 

Solution:  

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    if(!printf("Hello"))
        printf("Hello");
    else
        printf("World");
    getchar();
}        

Explanation: Printf returns the number of character it has printed successfully.  So, following solutions will also work
if (printf(“Hello”) < 0) or
if (printf(“Hello”) < 1) etc

Please comment if you find more solutions of this.
