Question 1

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int i;
	int power_of_ten[5] = {
							00001,
							00010,
							00100,
							01000,
							10000,
						};
	
	for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
		printf("%d ", power_of_ten[i]);
	printf("\n");
	
	return 0;
}

In the above example, we have created an array of 5 elements, whose elements are power of ten (i.e. 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000) and we are printing these element by using a  simple for loop. So we are expecting output of above program is ” 1 10 100 1000 and 10000″, but above program doesn’t show this output, instead it shows
"1 8 64 512 10000" 
Let us discuss above program in more detail. Inside array we declared elements which starts with “0”, and this is octal representation of decimal number (See this GFact for details).
That’s why all these numbers are in octal representation. “010” is octal representation of decimal “8”, “0100” is octal representation of decimal “64” and so on.
Last element “10000” which doesn’t start with “0”, that’s why it is in decimal format and it is printed as it is.
