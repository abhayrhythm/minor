given team n player 
mani minimum game requir find second best player 
use adversari argument base tournament tree binari heap 
tournament tree form min max heap complet binari tree 
everi extern node repres player intern node repres winner 
tournament tree everi intern node contain winner everi leaf node contain one player 
n 1 intern node binari tree n leaf extern node 
detail see post put n 2 equat given post 
obviou select best player among n player n 1 player elimin e 
need minimum n 1 game comparison 
mathemat prove 
binari tree e 1 number intern node e number extern node 
mean find maximum minimum element array need n 1 intern node comparison 
second best player inform explor best player select use minim number comparison trace next best player 
exampl pick second best player n log2n 2 comparison 
detail read comment 
follow diagram display tournament tree winner tree max heap 
note concept loser tree differ 
tree contain 4 leaf node repres player 3 level 0 1 2 initi 2 game conduct level 2 one 5 3 anoth one 7 8 next move one game conduct 5 8 conclud final winner 
overal need 3 comparison 
second best player need trace candid particip final winner lead 7 second best 
median sort array tournament tree effect use find median sort array 
assum given sort array equal size l simplic 
attach sort array tournament tree one array per leaf 
need tree height ceil log2m atleast extern node 
consid exampl 
given 3 3 sort integ array maximum size 5 element 
2 5 7 11 15 array1 1 3 4 array2 6 8 12 13 14 array3 height tournament tree 
need construct tournament tree height log23 1 585 2 round next integ 
binari tree height 2 4 leav attach array shown figur 
first tournament tree appear observ winner array2 
henc next element array2 dive game play along winner path previou tournament 
note infin use sentinel element 
base data hold node select sentinel charact 
exampl usual store pointer node rather key null serv sentinel 
array exhaust fill correspond leaf upcom intern node sentinel 
second tournament tree appear next winner array1 next element array1 array 5 dive next round next tournament play along path 2 tournament continu till get median element 5 3 5 2 7th element 
note even better algorithm find median union sort array detail see relat link given 
gener sort list size l1 l2 lm requir time complex l1 l2 lm logm merg array logm time find median median posit 
select smallest one million element one billion unsort element simpl solut sort billion number select first one million 
limit memori system sort billion element pick first one million seem impract 
use tournament tree approach 
time element tree memori 
split larg array perhap store disk smaller size array size one million even smaller sort machin 
sort 1000 small size array store disk individu file 
construct tournament tree atleast 1000 leaf node tree height 10 sinc 29 1000 210 individu file size even smaller need leaf node 
everi leaf node engin pick next element sort file store disk 
play tournament tree game extract first one million element 
total cost sort 1000 list one million tree construct tournament implement need build tree heap bottom manner 
leaf node fill first 
start left extrem tree fill along breadth e 
2k 1 2k 1 k depth tree play game
