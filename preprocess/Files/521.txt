
A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. The definition is similar to Suffix Tree which is compressed trie of all suffixes of the given text.

Let the given string be "banana".

0 banana                          5 a
1 anana     Sort the Suffixes     3 ana
2 nana      ---------------->     1 anana  
3 ana        alphabetically       0 banana  
4 na                              4 na   
5 a                               2 nana

The suffix array for "banana" is {5, 3, 1, 0, 4, 2} 
We have discussed Naive algorithm for construction of suffix array
