
Write a C code that prints “GeeksforGeeks” without any main function. This is a trick question and can be solved in following ways.
1) Using a macro that defines main

#include<stdio.h>
#define fun main
int fun(void)
{
    printf("Geeksforgeeks");
    return 0;
}
Output:
Geeksforgeeks
2) Using Token-Pasting Operator
The above solution has word ‘main’ in it.  If we are not allowed to even write main, we ca use token-pasting operator (see this for details)

#include<stdio.h>
#define fun m##a##i##n
int fun()
{
    printf("Geeksforgeeks");
    return 0;
}
Output:
Geeksforgeeks
