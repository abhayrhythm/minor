
Predict the output of following C programs.
Question 1

#include<stdio.h>

#define R 10
#define C 20

int main()
{
   int (*p)[R][C];
   printf("%d",  sizeof(*p));
   getchar();
   return 0;
}

Output: 10*20*sizeof(int) which is “800” for compilers with integer size as 4 bytes.
The pointer p is de-referenced, hence it yields type of the object. In the present case, it is an array of array of integers. So, it prints R*C*sizeof(int).
Thanks to Venki for suggesting this solution.
