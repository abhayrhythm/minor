
In C, it is possible to have array of all types except following.
1) void.
2) functions.
For example, below program throws compiler error

int main()
{
    void arr[100];
}

Output:
error: declaration of 'arr' as array of voids 
But we can have array of void pointers and function pointers. The below program works fine.

int main()
{
    void *arr[100];
}

See examples of function pointers for details of array function pointers.
