given undirect graph tree characterist 
possibl choos node root task find node minim height tree 
exampl diagram node made root one one see 3 4 root height tree minimum 2 3 4 answer 
solv problem first think 1 solut longest graph given node minim height mid node total node count odd mid two node total node count even 
solut reach follow approach start two pointer end path move one step time pointer meet one step away end pointer node minim height divid node evenli height minimum 
approach appli gener tree also 
start pointer leaf node move one step insid time keep combin pointer overlap move end one pointer remain vertex two pointer remain one distanc away 
node repres root vertex minim height tree 
one root max two root minimum height depend tree structur explain 
implement use actual pointer instead follow bf like approach start leaf node push queue remov tree next new leaf node push queue procedur keep go 1 2 node tree repres result 
access node total time complex solut n 
c program find root give minimum height tree includ bit stdc h use namespac std class repres undirect graph use adjac list represent class graph public int v
