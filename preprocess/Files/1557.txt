Given values of two nodes in a Binary Tree, find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). It may be assumed that both nodes exist in the tree. 

For example, consider the Binary Tree in diagram, LCA of 10 and 14 is 12 and LCA of 8 and 14 is 8.
Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself). Source : Wikipedia.

We have discussed different approaches to find LCA in set 1. Finding LCA becomes easy when parent pointer is given as we can easily find all ancestors of a node using parent pointer. 
Below are steps to find LCA.

 Create an empty hash table.  Insert n1 and all of its ancestors in hash table.
