
Consider below program in C.

// Please make sure that you compile this program
// using a C compiler, not a C++ compiler (Save your
// file .cpp). If using online compiler, select "C"
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   // Compound literal (an array is created without
   // any name and address of first element is assigned
   // to p.  This is equivalent to:
   // int arr[] = {2, 4, 6};
   // int *p = arr;
   int *p = (int []){2, 4, 6};

   printf("%d %d %d", p[0], p[1], p[2]);

   return 0;
}

Output:
2 4 6
The above example is an example of compound literals. Compound literals were introduced in C99 standard of C. Compound literals feature allows us to create unnamed objects with given list of initialized values.  In the above example, an array is created without any name. Address of first element of array is assigned to pointer p.
What is the use of it?
Compound literals are mainly used with structures and are particularly useful when passing structures variables to functions.  We can pass a structure object without defining it
For example, consider the below code.

// Please make sure that you compile this program
// using a C compiler, not a C++ compiler (Save your
// file .cpp). If using online compiler, select "C"
#include <stdio.h>

// Structure to represent a 2D point
struct Point
{
   int x, y;
};

// Utility function to print point
void printPoint(struct Point p)
{
   printf("%d, %d", p.x, p.y);
}

int main()
{
   // Calling printPoint() without creating any temporary
   // Point variable in main()
   printPoint((struct Point){2, 3});

   /*  Without compound literal, above statement would have
       been written as
       struct Point temp = {2, 3};
       printPoint(temp);  */

   return 0;
}

Output:
2, 3
