
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) of integer values and a range [low, high], return count of nodes where all the nodes under that node (or subtree rooted with that node) lie in the given range. 
Examples:

Input:
        10
      /    \
    5       50
   /       /  \
 1       40   100
Range: [5, 45]
Output:  1 
There is only 1 node whose subtree is in the given range.
The node is 40
