Hi everyone! I read a brilliant work by Aditya Prakash – OpenCV C++ Program to blur an image, so I decided to come up with something similar but this time in Python. So, here is a very simple program with basically the same result.

#Python Program to blur image
import cv2 
#This will give an error if you don't have cv2 module
img = cv2.imread('bat.jpg') #bat.jpg is the batman image.

#make sure that you have saved it in the same folder
blurImg = cv2.blur(img,(10,10)) #You can change the kernel size as you want
cv2.imshow('blurred image',blurImg)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Now, this program above is using image blurring technique called Averaging.There are some other options available as well – Gaussian Blurring, Median Blurring, Bilateral Filtering. Let’s make a couple of additions in our program and compare the results.
import cv2 #This will give an error if you don't have cv2 module
img = cv2.imread('bat.jpg') #bat.jpg is the batman image.
#make sure that you have saved it in the same folder

#Averaging
avging = cv2.blur(img,(10,10)) #You can change the kernel size as you want
cv2.imshow('Averaging',avging)
cv2.waitKey(0)

#Gaussian Blurring
gausBlur = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5,5),0) #Again, you can change the kernel size
cv2.imshow('Gaussian Blurring', gausBlur)
cv2.waitKey(0)

#Median blurring
medBlur = cv2.medianBlur(img,5)
cv2.imshow('Media Blurring', medBlur)
cv2.waitKey(0)

#Bilateral Filtering
bilFilter = cv2.bilateralFilter(img,9,75,75)
cv2.imshow('Bilateral Filtering', bilFilter)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Hope you enjoyed the post! Auf Wiedersehen!
