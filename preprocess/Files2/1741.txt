steiner tree 
given graph subset vertic graph steiner tree span though given subset 
steiner tree may contain vertic given subset use connect vertic subset 
given set vertic call termin vertic vertic use construct steiner tree call steiner vertic 
steiner tree problem find minimum cost steiner tree 
see exampl 
span tree vs steiner tree minimum span tree minimum weight tree span vertic 
given subset termin vertic equal set vertic steiner tree problem problem becom minimum span tree problem 
given subset contain two vertic shortest path problem two vertic 
find minimum span tree polynomi time solvabl minimum steiner tree problem np hard relat decis problem np complet 
applic steiner tree situat task minim cost connect among import locat like vlsi design comput network etc 
shortest path base approxim algorithm sinc steiner tree problem np hard polynomi time solut alway give optim cost 
therefor approxim algorithm solv 
one simpl approxim algorithm 
1 start subtre consist one given termin vertex 2 span termin select termin x closest vertex b add shortest path connect x algorithm 2 2 n approxim e guarante solut produc algorithm ration optim solut given graph n vertic 
better algorithm also provid better ratio
