
In C++, if a class has a constructor which can be called with a single argument, then this constructor becomes conversion constructor because such a constructor allows automatic conversion to the class being constructed. 

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;
class Test 
{
 private:
   int x;
 public:
   Test(int i) {x = i;}
   void show() { cout<<" x = "<<x<<endl; }
};

int main()
{
 Test t(20);
 t.show();
 t = 30; // conversion constructor is called here.
 t.show();
 getchar();
 return 0;
}

The above program prints:
 x = 20
 x = 30
