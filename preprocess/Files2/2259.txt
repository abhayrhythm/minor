n bike cover 100 km fulli fuel 
maximum amount distanc go use n bike 
may assum bike similar bike take 1 litr cover 1 km 
n bike use one bike cover 100 km 
n bike start point run simultan go 100 km 
let think bit differ trick want cover maximum distanc alway tri wast minimum fuel 
minimum wastag fuel mean run minimum number bike 
instead parallel run n bike think serial run 
mean transfer amount fuel last bike anoth bike throw last bike e run last bike certain point 
question distanc fuel transfer done maximum distanc cover fuel tank remain bike overflow 
let us take follow base case gener solut 
base case 1 one bike simpl cover 100 km 
base case 2 two bike maximum distanc cover 2 bike 
maxim distanc must drop second bike point transfer fuel first bike 
let transfer x km 
total distanc cover distanc cover 100 ltr first bike distanc cover fuel transfer first bike 
remain fuel second bike 100 x transfer much fuel first bike total distanc would becom 100 100 x 200 x task maxim 200 x 
constraint 100 x must less equal space creat first bike x km e 100 x x valu 200 x becom maximum x minimum 
minimum possibl valu x 50 abl travel 150 km 
base case 3 three bike let first transfer done x km 
x distanc bike contain 100 x amount fuel 
take 100 x amount fuel 3rd bike distribut among 1st 2nd bike fuel tank 1st 2nd bike get full 
100 x 2 x x 33 333 transfer remain fuel third bike distribut amount fuel among 1st 2nd bike exactli 33 33 km 
let us gener 
take closer look case observ n bike first transfer done bike drop 100 n km 
gener x litr remain fuel everi bike n remain bike drop bike x n km 
follow c implement gener function 
includ stdio h return maximum distanc travel n bike given fuel everi bike doubl maxdist int n int fuel dist_cov result function doubl dist_cov 0 n 0 ever fuel n km discard one bike fill bike fuel n liter fuel e 
maximum limit 100 litr dist_cov doubl fuel n n 1 reduc number bike return dist_cov driver program test function int main int n 3 number bike int fuel 100 printf maximum distanc possibl bike f n maxdist n fuel return 0 output maximum distanc possibl 3 bike 183 333333 articl contribut shamik mitra
