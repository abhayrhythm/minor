
Here is a solution that prints numbers using recursion.

Other alternatives for loop statements are recursion and goto statement,  but use of goto is not suggestible as a general programming practice as goto statement changes the normal program execution sequence and makes it difficult to undestand and maintain.  

#include <stdio.h>

/* Prints numbers from 1 to n */
void printNos(unsigned int n)
{
  if(n > 0)
  {
    printNos(n-1);
    printf("%d ",  n);
  }
  return;
}

/* Driver program to test printNos */
int main()
{
  printNos(100);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

Time Complexity: O(n)
Now try writing a program that does the same but without any if construct. 
Print 1 to 100 in C++, without loop and recursion
