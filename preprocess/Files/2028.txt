
In C++, this  pointer is passed as a hidden argument to all non-static member function calls.  The type of this  depends upon function declaration. If the member function of a class X is declared const, the type of this is const X* (see code 1 below), if the member function is declared volatile, the type of this is volatile X* (see code 2 below), and if the member function is declared const volatile, the type of this is const volatile X* (see code 3 below).
Code 1

#include<iostream>
class X {
   void fun() const {
    // this is passed as hidden argument to fun(). 
    // Type of this is const X* 
    }
};

Code 2

#include<iostream>
class X {
   void fun() volatile {
     // this is passed as hidden argument to fun(). 
     // Type of this is volatile X* 
    }
};

Code 3

#include<iostream>
class X {
   void fun() const volatile {
     // this is passed as hidden argument to fun(). 
     // Type of this is const volatile X* 
    }
};
