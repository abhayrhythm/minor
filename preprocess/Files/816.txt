The main object of this project is to provide the database in GUI oriented format through which we can retrieve information about the remote database and their tables for proper manipulation. GUI programming can be done in JAVA IDE.
Features
This Universal Persistent Viewer is a utility for database browsing. It provides an interface for viewing a database. We can browse a remote database also and change its contents even if the client side software is not available for the database.
One main important aspect of this project is SQL interpreter, which is used to execute queries by which the table can be modified. Queries can also be executed in this utility. The records can be added deleted and modified in a table. Records can be viewed with the specified condition.
