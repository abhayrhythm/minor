
Following questions have been asked in GATE 2012 exam.
1. What will be the output of the following C program segment?
  
    char inchar = 'A';
    switch (inchar)
    {
    case 'A' :
        printf ("choice A \n") ;
    case 'B' :
        printf ("choice B ") ;
    case 'C' :
    case 'D' :
    case 'E' :
    default:
        printf ("No Choice") ;
    }

(A) No choice
(B) Choice A
(C) Choice A
     Choice B No choice
(D) Program gives no output as it is erroneous
Answer (C)
There is no break statement in case ‘A’.  If a case is executed and it doesn’t contain break, then all the subsequent cases are executed until a break statement is found.  That is why everything inside the switch is printed.
Try following program as an exercise.

int main()
{
    char inchar = 'A';
    switch (inchar)
    {
    case 'A' :
        printf ("choice A \n") ;
    case 'B' :
    {
        printf ("choice B") ;
        break;
    }
    case 'C' :
    case 'D' :
    case 'E' :
    default:
        printf ("No Choice") ;
    }
}
