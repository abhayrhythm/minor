calcul time taken process use clock function avail time h 
call clock function begin end code measur time subtract valu divid clocks_per_sec number clock tick per second get processor time like follow 
includ time h clock_t start end doubl cpu_time_us start clock work 
end clock cpu_time_us doubl end start clocks_per_sec follow sampl c program measur time taken fun 
function fun wait enter key press termin 
program demonstr time taken function fun includ stdio h includ time h function termin enter key press void fun printf fun start n printf press enter stop fun n 1 getchar break printf fun end n main program call fun measur time taken fun int main calcul time taken fun clock_t clock fun clock doubl time_taken doubl clocks_per_sec second printf fun took f second execut n time_taken return 0 output follow output obtain wait around 4 second hit enter key
