
Given a binary string, count minimum number of subsequences to be removed to make it an empty string.
Examples:

Input: str[] = "10001"
Output: 1
Since the whole string is palindrome, 
we need only one removal.

Input: str[] = "10001001"
Output: 2
We can remove the middle 1 as first 
removal, after first removal string
becomes 1000001 which is a palindrome.

Expected time complexity : O(n)

The problem is simple and can be solved easily using below two facts.
1) If given string is palindrome, we need only one removal.
2) Else we need two removals. Note that every binary string has all 1’s as a subsequence and all 0’s as another subsequence.  We can remove any of the two subsequences to get a unary string.  A unary string is always palindrome.

// C++ program to count minimum palindromic subsequences
// to be removed to make an string empty.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// A function to check if a string str is palindrome
bool isPalindrome(const char *str)
{
    // Start from leftmost and rightmost corners of str
    int l = 0;
    int h = strlen(str) - 1;

    // Keep comparing characters while they are same
    while (h > l)
        if (str[l++] != str[h--])
            return false;

    return true;
}

// Returns count of minimum palindromic subseuqnces to
// be removed to make string empty
int minRemovals(const char *str)
{
   // If string is empty
   if (str[0] == '\0')
      return 0;

   // If string is palindrome
   if (isPalindrome(str))
      return 1;

   // If string is not palindrome
   return 2;
}

// Driver code to test above
int main()
{
   cout << minRemovals("010010") << endl;
   cout << minRemovals("0100101") << endl;
   return 0;
}

Output :

1
2
