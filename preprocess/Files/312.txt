A matching in a Bipartite Graph is a set of the edges chosen in such a way that no two edges share an endpoint. A maximum matching is a matching of maximum size (maximum number of edges).  In a  maximum matching, if any edge is added to it, it is no longer a matching. There can be more than one maximum matchings for a given Bipartite Graph.  
Why do we care?
There are many real world problems that can be formed as Bipartite Matching. For example, consider the following problem:
There are M job applicants and N jobs. Each applicant has a subset of jobs that he/she is interested in. Each job opening can only accept one applicant and a job applicant can be appointed for only one job. Find an assignment of jobs to applicants in such that as many applicants as possible get jobs.

We strongly recommend to read the following post first.

Maximum Bipartite Matching and Max Flow Problem
Maximum Bipartite Matching (MBP) problem can be solved by converting it into a flow network (See this video to know how did we arrive this conclusion).   Following are the steps.
1) Build a Flow Network
There must be a source and sink in a flow network.  So we add a source and add edges from source to all applicants.  Similarly, add edges from all jobs to sink. The capacity of every edge is marked as 1 unit.
