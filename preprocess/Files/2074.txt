
In C++, a static member function of a class cannot be virtual.  For example, below program gives compilation error.

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;    
 
class Test
{
   public:
      // Error: Virtual member functions cannot be static      
      virtual static void fun()  { }
};


Also, static member function cannot be const and volatile.  Following code also fails in compilation.

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;    
 
class Test
{
   public:
      // Error: Static member function cannot be const
      static void fun() const { } 
};
