hi 
interview experi internship amazon 
posit 2 month intern 
round 1 onlin 2 pi 2 f2f round 1 90 minut 20 mcq 2 code question 20 mcq base c output probabl basic math oop algorithm analysi oper system 
question 1 given link list write function revers everi k node k input function 
exampl input 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 null k 3 output 3 2 1 6 5 4 8 7 null 
input 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 null k 5 output 5 4 3 2 1 8 7 6 null 
question 2 given string contain word separ arbitrari number space 
write function return string consist first letter word 
note may number space start given string end given string word string 
exampl input test case output tiatc function prototyp main given question 
although mani solut pass initi test case reject later satisfi boundari case 
round 2 face face 1 hour 20 min question 1 given two number repres two link list write function return sum list 
sum list link list represent addit two input number 
exampl input first list 5 6 3 repres number 563 second list 8 4 2 repres number 842 output result list 1 4 0 5 repres number 1405 revers link list simpli ad correspond node along carri 
ask solv question without revers list 
solv question iter without revers list 
interview ask write recurs code problem 
ask modifi code carri place pass valu instead use pointer use code 
question 2 iter recurs code revers link list take care corner case list node contain singl node question 3 write function check whether binari tree sub tree anoth binari tree check corner case 
solv n 2 time complex 
ask optim code 
question 4 data structur would use keep record stock market 
ask clarifi problem statement 
ask suppos maintain stock valu variou compani variou period return minimum stock valu particular compani given period time 
answer segment tree probabl correct answer queue data structur 
howev interview proceed question segment tree 
ask write code creat segment tree b perform rang minimum queri segment tree c updat segment tree ask analyz time complex build segment tree perform rang minimum queri segment tree 
ask maintain stock valu compani past 6 month updat segment tree everi day delet stock valu insert new stock valu 
would 
got stuck could perform updat better n time 
howev use queue perform 1 time 
final ask question 
round 3 face face 20 min one technic question ask round 
ask speak someth technic achiev b store binari tree file read back 
necessarili bst first answer would store level order travers tree 
ask would maintain node variou level unabl answer 
chang approach told would store order pre order travers tree origin tree easili retriev 
told optim approach approach would requir twice origin space store data node 
could optim approach howev better approach use parenthes 
b c e binari tree store b e c file 
c 10 min discuss project problem encount solv 
final ask question 
ask intern project amazon use dbm network 
start elabor entir work process amazon work experi could hardli understand 
also told good knowledg java requir stage project 
final got select
