
Write a C program to find the smallest of three integers, without using any of the comparison operators. 
Let 3 input numbers be x, y and z.
Method 1 (Repeated Subtraction)
Take a counter variable c and initialize it with 0.  In a loop, repeatedly subtract x, y and z by 1 and increment c.  The number which becomes 0 first is the smallest.  After the loop terminates, c will hold the minimum of 3.

#include<stdio.h>

int smallest(int x, int y, int z)
{
  int c = 0;
  while ( x && y && z )
  {
      x--;  y--; z--; c++;
  }
  return c;
}

int main()
{
   int x = 12, y = 15, z = 5;
   printf("Minimum of 3 numbers is %d", smallest(x, y, z));
   return 0;
}

This methid doesnâ€™t work for negative numbers.  Method 2 works for negative nnumbers also.
