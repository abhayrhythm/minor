solut let us first convert length cm 
length 450 cm 990 cm 1620 cm 
need find length largest plank use measur length largest plank take least time 
need take hcf 450 990 1620 
450 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 5 2 x 32 x 52 990 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 11 2 x 32 x 5 x 11 1620 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 5 22 x 34 x 5 therefor hcf 450 990 1620 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 90 thu need plank length 90 cm measur given length least time 
question 3 find greatest number divid 70 50 leav remaind 1 4 respect 
solut requir number leav remaind 1 4 divid 70 50 respect 
mean number exactli divid 69 46 need find hcf 69 3 x 23 46 2 x 23 
hcf 69 46 23 thu 23 requir number 
question 4 find largest number divid 64 136 238 leav remaind case 
solut find requir number need find hcf 136 64 238 136 238 64 e hcf 72 102 174 
72 23 x 32 102 2 x 3 x 17 174 2 x 3 x 29 therefor hcf 72 102 174 2 x 3 6 henc 6 requir number 
question 5 find least number divid 5 7 9 12 leav remaind 3 case solut type question need find lcm divisor add common remaind 3 
lcm 5 7 9 12 1260 therefor requir number 1260 3 1263 question 6 find largest four digit number exactli divis 15 21 28 solut largest four digit number 9999 lcm 15 21 28 420 divid 9999 420 get 339 remaind 
therefor requir number 9999 339 9660 question 7 policemen three differ place ground blow whistl everi 42 sec 60 sec 78 sec respect 
blow whistl simultan 9 30 00 hour time whistl togeth 
solut whistl time interv equal lcm individu whistl blow cycl 
lcm 42 60 78 2 x 3 x 7 x 10 x 13 5460 therefor blow whistl simultan 5460 sec e 1 hour 31 minut e 11 01 00 hour 
question 8 find least number divid 6 7 8 leav remaind 3 divid 9 leav remaind 
solut lcm 6 7 8 168 number form 168m 3 168m 3 divis 9 know number divis 9 sum digit multipl 9 1 number 168 3 171 sum whose digit 9 therefor requir number 171 question 9 two number ratio 2 3 product lcm hcf 294 find number 
solut let common ratio 
number 2m 3m 
know product number product lcm hcf 
2m x 3m 294 m2 49 7 therefor number 14 21 question 10 rectangular field dimens 180m x 105m pave ident squar tile

solut need find size squar tile number tile cover field exactli leav area unpav 
find hcf length breadth field 
hcf 180 105 15 therefor size tile 15m x 15m also number tile area field area tile number tile 180 x 105 15 x 15 number tile 84 henc need 84 tile size 15m x 15m 
question 11 three rectangular field area 60 m2 84 m2 108 m2 divid ident rectangular flower bed length 6 find breadth flower bed 
solut need divid larg field smaller flower bed area bed 
find hcf larger field give us area smaller field 
hcf 60 84 108 12 hcf area m2 flower bed 
also area rectangular field length x breadth 12 6 x breadth breadth 2 henc flower bed would 2 wide
