
Consider the following program.  Predict the output of it when compiled with C and C++ compilers.

void func()
{
    /* definition */
}

int main()
{
    func();
    func(2);
}

The above program compiles fine in C, but doesn’t compiler in C++.
In C++, func() is equivalent to func(void)
In C,   func() is equivalent to func(…)
Refer this for details and this for more programs that compile in C, but not in C++.
