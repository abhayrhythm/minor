
We will discuss about four file hacks listed as below-

Rename –  Rename a file using C/C++
Remove – Remove a file using C/C++
File Size –  Get the file size using C/C++
Check existence – Check whether a file exists or not in C/C++  


// A C++ Program to demonstrate the
// four file hacks every C/C++ must know

// Note that we are assuming that the files
// are present in the same file as the program
// before doing the below four hacks
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<stdbool.h>

// A Function to get the file size
unsigned long long int fileSize(const char *filename)
{
    // Open the file
    FILE *fh = fopen(filename, "rb");
    fseek(fh, 0, SEEK_END);
    unsigned long long int size = ftell(fh);
    fclose(fh);

    return (size);
}

// A Function to check if the file exists or not
bool fileExists(const char * fname)
{
    FILE *file;
    if (file = fopen(fname, "r"))
    {
        fclose(file);
        return (true);
    }
    return (false);
}

// Driver Program to test above functions
int main()
{
    printf("%llu Bytes\n", fileSize("Passwords.txt"));
    printf("%llu Bytes\n", fileSize("Notes.docx"));

    if (fileExists("OldData.txt") == true )
        printf("The File exists\n");
    else
        printf("The File doen't exist\n");

    rename("Videos", "English_Videos");
    rename("Songs", "English_Songs");

    remove("OldData.txt");
    remove("Notes.docx");

    if (fileExists("OldData.txt") == true )
        printf("The File exists\n");
    else
        printf("The File doesn't exist\n");

    return 0;
