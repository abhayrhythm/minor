question 1 given direct weight graph 
also given shortest path sourc vertex destin vertex 
weight everi edg increas 10 unit shortest path remain modifi graph 
shortest path may chang 
reason may differ number edg differ path exampl let shortest path weight 15 5 edg 
let anoth path 2 edg total weight 25 weight shortest path increas 5 10 becom 15 50 weight path increas 2 10 becom 25 20 shortest path chang path weight 45 question 2 similar question 
shortest path chang weight edg multipli 10 
multipli edg weight 10 shortest path chang 
reason simpl weight path get multipli amount 
number edg path matter 
like chang unit weight 
question 3 given direct graph everi edg weight either 1 2 find shortest path given sourc vertex given destin vertex 
expect time complex v e 
appli dijkstra shortest path algorithm get shortest path e vlogv time 
v e time 
idea use bf 
one import observ bf path use bf alway least number edg two vertic 
edg weight use bf find shortest path 
problem modifi graph split edg weight 2 two edg weight 1 
modifi graph use bf find shortest path 
approach v e 
worst case edg weight 2 need e oper split edg time complex becom e v e v e 
question 4 given direct acycl weight graph find shortest path sourc destin v e time 
see shortest path direct acycl graph question see follow link question
