start 2 simpl data structur program 30 aptitud question luckili clear round qualifi person interview 
ask data structur question technic one two 
longest sum contigu sub array 
saw solut question day interview interview clue whatsoev gave stupid solut question correct solut use kadan algorithm 
find duplic string 
find duplic array 
given binari array 0s 1s sort ascend order 0s left 1s right 
first gave n n solut

gave clue use two pointer one start one end achiev singl iter 
answer question except first one correctli also show interest toward compani ask question compani push next round

day 
etc

given array number 1 100 arrang random order one number miss find miss number 
told could sum element array get sum subtract sum first 100 element 100 101 2 5050 get miss number 
happi answer move next question
