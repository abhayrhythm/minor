
Explain the functionality of following functions. 
Question 1

int fun1(int x, int y) 
{
  if(x == 0)
    return y;
  else
    return fun1(x - 1,  x + y);
}

Answer: The function fun() calculates and returns ((1 + 2 â€¦ + x-1 + x) +y) which is x(x+1)/2 + y.  For example if x is 5 and y is 2, then fun should return 15 + 2 = 17.
