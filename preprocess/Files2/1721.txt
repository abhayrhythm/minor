mother vertex 
mother vertex graph g v e vertex v vertic g reach path v exampl input graph output 5 one mother vertic graph 
need output anyon 
exampl graph vertic 0 1 2 mother vertic

find mother vertex 
case 1 undirect connect graph case vertic mother vertic reach node graph 
case 2 undirect direct disconnect graph case mother vertic cannot reach node graph 
case 3 direct connect graph case find vertex v graph reach node graph direct path 
naiv approach trivial approach perform df bf vertic find whether reach vertic vertex 
approach take v e v time ineffici larg graph 
better 
find mother vertex v e time 
idea base kosaraju strongli connect compon algorithm

idea base fact 
exist mother vertex vertic one mother vertic last finish vertex df 
mother vertex maximum finish time df travers 
vertex said finish df recurs call df e descend vertex visit 
idea work 
let last finish vertex v basic need prove cannot edg anoth vertex u v u anoth mother vertex cannot exist non mother vertex u u v edg 
two possibl 
recurs df call made u v edg u v exist v must finish u v reachabl u vertex finish descend 
recurs df call made v u case also edg u v exist either v must finish u contradict assumpt v finish end u reachabl v mean u anoth mother vertex 
algorithm df travers given graph 
travers keep track last finish vertex v 
step take v e time 
exist mother vertex vetic v must one one 
check v mother vertex df bf v step also take v e time 
c implement algorithm
