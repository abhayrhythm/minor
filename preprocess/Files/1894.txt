
Given two arrays such that first array has enough extra space to accommodate elements of second array.  How to concatenate second array to first in C without using any loop in program?
Example:

Input: arr1[5] = {1, 2, 3}
       arr2[]  = {4, 5}
Output: arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

We strongly recommend you to minimize your browser and try this yourself first.
 
Hint: We may use library functions in C.
The idea is to use memcpy() or memmove() in C.

// arr1[] is of size m+n and arr2[] is of size n. This function
// appends contents of arr2[] at the end of arr1[]
void concatenate(int arr1[], int arr2[], int m, int n)
{
   memcpy(arr1 + m, arr2, sizeof(arr2)); 
}
