
What will be the output of the following C program? 

int main()
{
   int a = 3, b = -8, c = 2;
   printf("%d", a % b / c);
   return 0;
}

The output is 1.
% and / have same precedence and left to right associativity. So % is performed first which results in 3 and / is performed next resulting in 1. The emphasis is, sign of left operand is appended to result in case of modulus operator in C.
