
One method of adding ratios is discussed in this article below 
Program to add two fractions
The above method involves a tedious and lengthy task. But C++ has a header file  , which allows us to manipulate ratios using various inbuilt templete alias. This header file in introduced C++11 onwards.
1. ratio_add :- This templete alias is used to add two ratios and return the result in simplest form. It returns two member constants, num and den denoting numerator and denominator.
2. ratio_subtract :- This templete alias is used to subtract two ratios and return the result in simplest form. It returns two member constants, num and den denoting numerator and denominator. It subtracts ratio2 from ratio1.

// C++ code to demonstrate the working of
// ratio_add and ratio_subtract
#include<iostream>
#include<ratio> // for ratio manipulation
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    // Declaring ratios 
    typedef ratio<5, 4> ratio1;
    typedef ratio<3, 4> ratio2;
    
    // Summing two ratios
    typedef ratio_add< ratio1, ratio2 > sum; 
    
    // Subtracting two ratios
     typedef ratio_subtract< ratio1, ratio2 > diff; 
     
    // printing sum of ratios
    cout << "The sum of ratios is : ";
    cout << sum::num << "/" << sum::den;
    cout << endl;
    
    // printing difference of ratios
    cout << "The difference of ratios is : ";
    cout << diff::num << "/" << diff::den;
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
    
}

Output:

The sum of ratios is : 2/1
The difference of ratios is : 1/2


3. ratio_multiply :- This templete alias is used to multiply two ratios and return the result in simplest form. It returns two member constants, num and den denoting numerator and denominator.
4. ratio_divide :- This templete alias is used to divide two ratios and return the result in simplest form. It returns two member constants, num and den denoting numerator and denominator. It divides ratio1 by ratio2.

// C++ code to demonstrate the working of
// ratio_multiply and ratio_divide
#include<iostream>
#include<ratio> // for ratio manipulation
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    // Declaring ratios 
    typedef ratio<5, 4> ratio1;
    typedef ratio<3, 4> ratio2;
    
    // Multiplying two ratios
    typedef ratio_multiply< ratio1, ratio2 > prod; 
    
    // Dividing two ratios
     typedef ratio_divide< ratio1, ratio2 > div; 
     
    // printing product of ratios
    cout << "The product of ratios is : ";
    cout << prod::num << "/" << prod::den;
    cout << endl;
    
    // printing division of ratios
    cout << "The division of ratios is : ";
    cout << div::num << "/" << div::den;
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
    
}

Output:

The product of ratios is : 15/16
The division of ratios is : 5/3
