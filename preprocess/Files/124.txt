
Given a string ‘str’ of digits, find  length of the longest substring of ‘str’, such that the length of the substring is 2k digits and sum of left k digits is equal to the sum of right k digits. 
Examples:

Input: str = "123123"
Output: 6
The complete string is of even length and sum of first and second
half digits is same

Input: str = "1538023"
Output: 4
The longest substring with same first and second half sum is "5380"

Simple Solution [ O(n3) ]
A Simple Solution is to check every substring of even length.  The following is C based implementation of simple approach.

// A simple C based program to find length of longest  even length
// substring with same sum of digits in left and right 
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

int findLength(char *str)
{
    int n = strlen(str);
    int maxlen =0;  // Initialize result

    // Choose starting point of every substring
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
        // Choose ending point of even length substring
        for (int j =i+1; j<n; j += 2)
        {
            int length = j-i+1;//Find length of current substr

            // Calculate left & right sums for current substr
            int leftsum = 0, rightsum =0;
            for (int k =0; k<length/2; k++)
            {
                leftsum  += (str[i+k]-'0');
                rightsum += (str[i+k+length/2]-'0');
            }

            // Update result if needed
            if (leftsum == rightsum && maxlen < length)
                    maxlen = length;
        }
    }
    return maxlen;
}

// Driver program to test above function
int main(void)
{
    char str[] = "1538023";
    printf("Length of the substring is %d", findLength(str));
    return 0;
}

Output:
Length of the substring is 4
