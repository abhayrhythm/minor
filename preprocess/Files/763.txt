The money that the principal generates is called Interest. This is the money generated as a result of borrowing/lending.
Compound Interest is the interest calculated on the cumulative amount, rather than being calculated on the principal amount only.
Amount, A = P [1 + (R / 100)]n, where P is the principal, R is the rate of interest per unit time period and n is the time period.
Compound Interest, CI = Amount – Principal
If compounding period is not annual, rate of interest is divided in accordance with the compounding period. For example, if interest is compounded half yearly, then rate of interest would be R / 2, where ‘R’ is the annual rate of interest.

If interest is compounded daily, rate of interest = R / 365 and A = P [ 1 + ( {R / 365} / 100 ) ]T, where ‘T’ is the time period. For example, if we have to calculate the interest for 1 year, then T = 365. For 2 years, T = 730.
If interest is compounded monthly, rate of interest = R / 12 and A = P [ 1 + ( {R / 12} / 100 ) ]T, where ‘T’ is the time period. For example, if we have to calculate the interest for 1 year, then T = 12. For 2 years, T = 24.
If interest is compounded half yearly, rate of interest = R / 2 and A = P [ 1 + ( {R / 2} / 100 ) ]T, where ‘T’ is the time period. For example, if we have to calculate the interest for 1 year, then T = 2. For 2 years, T = 4.


For finding the time period in which a sum of money will double itself at R % rate of compound interest compounded annually, we generally use either of the following two formulas :

Time, T = 72 / R Years
Time, T = 0.35 + (69 / R) Years


When rate of interest is different for different years, say R1, R2, R3 and so on, the amount is calculated as A = P [1 + (R1 / 100)] [1 + (R2 / 100)] [1 + (R3 / 100)] …

Sample Problems
Question 1 : Find the compound interest on Rs. 10,000 at 10% per annum for a time period of three and a half years.
Solution : Time period of 3 years and 6 months means for 3 years, the interest is compounded yearly and for the remaining 6 months, the interest is compounded compounded half yearly. This means that we have 3 cycles of interest compounded yearly and 1 cycle of interest compounded half yearly.
So, Amount = P [1 + (R / 100)]3 [1 + ( {R/2} / 100 )]
=> Amount = 10000 [1 + 0.1]3 [1 + 0.05]
=> Amount = 10000 (1.1)3 (1.05)
=> Amount = Rs. 13975.50
=> Compound Interest, CI = Amount – Principal = 13975.50 – 10000
Therefore, CI = Rs. 3975.50
Question 2 : If Rs. 5000 amounts to Rs. 5832 in two years compounded annually, find the rate of interest per annum.
Solution : Here, P = 5000, A = 5832, n = 2
A = P [1 + (R / 100)]n
=> 5832 = 5000 [1 + (R / 100)]2
=> [1 + (R / 100)]2 = 5832 / 5000
=> [1 + (R / 100)]2 = 11664 / 10000
=> [1 + (R / 100)] = 108 / 100
=> R / 100 = 8 / 100
=> R = 8 %
Thus, the required rate of interest per annum in 8 %
Question 3 : The difference between the SI and CI on a certain sum of money at 10 % rate of annual interest for 2 years is Rs. 549. Find the sum.
Solution : Let the sum be P.
R = 10 %
n = 2 years
SI = P x R x n / 100 = P x 10 x 2 / 100 = 0.20 P
CI = A – P = P [1 + (R / 100)]n – P = 0.21 P
Now, it is given that CI – SI = 549
=> 0.21 P – 0.20 P = 549
=> 0.01 P = 549
=> P = 54900
Therefore, the required sum of money is Rs. 54,900
Question 4 : A sum of Rs. 1000 is to be divided among two brothers such that if the interest being compounded annually is 5 % per annum, then the money with the first brother after 4 years is equal to the money with the second brother after 6 years.
Solution : Let the first brother be given Rs. P
=> Money with second brother = Rs. 1000 – P
Now, according to the question,
P [1 + (5 / 100)]4 = (1000 – P) [1 + (5 / 100)]6
=> P (1.05)4 = (1000 – P) (1.05)6
=> 0.9070 P = 1000 – P
=> 1.9070 P = 1000
=> P = 524.38
Therefore, share of first brother = Rs. 524.38
Share of second brother = Rs. 475.62
Question 5 : A sum of money amounts to Rs. 669 after 3 years and to Rs. 1003.50 after 6 years on compound interest. Find the sum.
Solution : Let the sum of money be Rs. P
=> P [1 + (R/100)]3= 669 and P [1 + (R/100)]6= 1003.50
Dividing both equations, we get
[1 + (R/100)]3 = 1003.50 / 669 = 1.50
Now, we put this value in the equation P [1 + (R/100)]3= 669
=> P x 1.50 = 669
=> P = 446
Thus, the required sum of money is Rs. 446
Question 6 : An investment doubles itself in 15 years if the interest is compounded annually. How many years will it take to become 8 times?
Solution : it is given that the investment doubles itself in 15 years.
Let the initial investment be Rs. P
=> At the end of 15 years, A = 2 P
Now, this 2 P will be invested.
=> Amount after 15 more years = 2 x 2 P = 4 P
Now, this 4 P will be invested.
=> Amount after 15 more years = 2 x 4 P = 8 P
Thus, the investment (P) will become 8 times (8 P) in 15 + 15 + 15 = 45 years
