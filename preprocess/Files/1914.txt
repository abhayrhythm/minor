
In C, we can specify size (in bits) of structure and union members.  The idea is to use memory efficiently when we know that the value of a field or group of fields will never exceed a limit or is withing a small range.  
For example, consider the following declaration of date without use of bit fields.

#include <stdio.h>

// A simple representation of date
struct date
{
   unsigned int d;
   unsigned int m;
   unsigned int y;
};

int main()
{
   printf("Size of date is %d bytes\n", sizeof(struct date));
   struct date dt = {31, 12, 2014};
   printf("Date is %d/%d/%d", dt.d, dt.m, dt.y);
}
Output:
Size of date is 12 bytes
Date is 31/12/2014
The above representation of ‘date’ takes 12 bytes on a compiler where an unsigned int takes 4 bytes.  Since we know that the value of d is always from 1 to 31, value of m is from 1 to 12, we can optimize the space using bit fields.

#include <stdio.h>

// A space optimized representation of date
struct date
{
   // d has value between 1 and 31, so 5 bits
   // are sufficient
   unsigned int d: 5;

   // m has value between 1 and 12, so 4 bits
   // are sufficient
   unsigned int m: 4;

   unsigned int y;
};

int main()
{
   printf("Size of date is %d bytes\n", sizeof(struct date));
   struct date dt = {31, 12, 2014};
   printf("Date is %d/%d/%d", dt.d, dt.m, dt.y);
   return 0;
} 
Output:
Size of date is 8 bytes
Date is 31/12/2014
Following are some interesting facts about bit fields in C.
1) A special unnamed bit field of size 0 is used to force alignment on next boundary.   For example consider the following program.

#include <stdio.h>

// A structure without forced alignment
struct test1
{
   unsigned int x: 5;
   unsigned int y: 8;
};

// A structure with forced alignment
struct test2
{
   unsigned int x: 5;
   unsigned int: 0;
   unsigned int y: 8;
};

int main()
{
   printf("Size of test1 is %d bytes\n", sizeof(struct test1));
   printf("Size of test2 is %d bytes\n", sizeof(struct test2));
   return 0;
}
Output:
Size of test1 is 4 bytes
Size of test2 is 8 bytes
 
2) We cannot have pointers to bit field members as they may not start at a byte boundary. 

#include <stdio.h>
struct test
{
   unsigned int x: 5;
   unsigned int y: 5;
   unsigned int z;
};
int main()
{
   test t;

   // Uncommenting the following line will make
   // the program compile and run
   printf("Address of t.x is %p", &t.x);

   // The below line works fine as z is not a
   // bit field member
   printf("Address of t.z is %p", &t.z);
   return 0;
}
Output: 
 error: attempt to take address of bit-field structure member 'test::x' 
 
3)  It is implementation defined to assign an out-of-range value to a bit field member.

#include <stdio.h>
struct test
{
   unsigned int x: 2;
   unsigned int y: 2;
   unsigned int z: 2;
};
int main()
{
   test t;
   t.x = 5;
   printf("%d", t.x);
   return 0;
}

Output:
Implementation-Dependent
 
4) In C++, we can have static members in a structure/class, but bit fields cannot be static.

// The below C++ program compiles and runs fine
struct test1 {
   static unsigned int x;
};
int main() {  }


// But below C++ program fails in compilation as bit fields
// cannot be static
struct test1 {
   static unsigned int x: 5;
};
int main() {  }
// error: static member 'x' cannot be a bit-field

 
5)  Array of bit fields is not allowed.  For example, the below program fails in compilation.

struct test
{
  unsigned int x[10]: 5;
};

int main()
{

}

Output:
error: bit-field 'x' has invalid type
 
 
Exercise:
Predict the output of following programs.  Assume that unsigned int takes 4 bytes and long int takes 8 bytes.
1)

#include <stdio.h>
struct test
{
   unsigned int x;
   unsigned int y: 33;
   unsigned int z;
};
int main()
{
   printf("%d", sizeof(struct test));
   return 0;
}
 
2)

#include <stdio.h>
struct test
{
   unsigned int x;
   long int y: 33;
   unsigned int z;
};
int main()
{
   struct test t;
   unsigned int *ptr1 = &t.x;
   unsigned int *ptr2 = &t.z;
   printf("%d", ptr2 - ptr1);
   return 0;
}

 
3) 

union test
{
  unsigned int x: 3;
  unsigned int y: 3;
  int z;
};

int main()
{    
   union test t;
   t.x = 5;
   t.y = 4;
   t.z = 1;
   printf("t.x = %d, t.y = %d, t.z = %d",
           t.x, t.y, t.z);
   return 0;
}
 
4) Use bit fields in C to figure out a way whether a machine is little endian or big endian.
