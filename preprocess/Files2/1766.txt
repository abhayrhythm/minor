solut infeas 
fact polynomi time solut avail problem problem known np hard problem 
approxim algorithm solv problem though 
approxim algorithm work problem instanc satisfi triangl inequ 
triangl inequ least distant path reach vertex j alway reach j directli rather vertex k vertic e di j alway less equal di k dist k j 
triangl inequ hold mani practic situat 
cost function satisfi triangl inequ design approxim algorithm tsp return tour whose cost never twice cost optim tour 
idea use minimum span tree mst 
follow mst base algorithm 
algorithm 1 let 1 start end point salesman 
2 construct mst 1 root use prim algorithm 
3 list vertic visit preorder walk construct mst add 1 end 
let us consid follow exampl 
first diagram given graph 
second diagram show mst construct 1 root 
preorder travers mst 1 2 4 3 ad 1 end give 1 2 4 3 1 output algorithm
