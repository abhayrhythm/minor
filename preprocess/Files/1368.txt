
Given two sorted linked lists, construct a linked list that contains maximum sum path from start to end. The result list may contain nodes from both input lists. When constructing the result list, we may switch to the other input list only at the point of intersection (which mean the two node with the same value in the lists). You are allowed to use O(1) extra space.

Input:
List1 =  1->3->30->90->120->240->511
List2 =  0->3->12->32->90->125->240->249

Output: Following is maximum sum linked list out of two input lists
list =  1->3->12->32->90->125->240->511
we switch at 3 and 240 to get above maximum sum linked list

We strongly recommend to minimize the browser and try this yourself first.
The idea here in the below solution is to adjust next pointers after common nodes.
1. Start with head of both linked lists and find first common node. Use merging technique of sorted linked list for that.
2. Keep track of sum of the elements too while doing this and set head of result list based on greater sum till first common node.
3. After this till the current pointers of both lists don’t become NULL we need to adjust the next of prev pointers based on greater sum.
This way it can be done in-place with constant extra space.
Time complexity of the below solution is O(n).

Time complexity = O(n) where n is the length of bigger linked list
Auxiliary space = O(1)
However a problem in this solution is that the original lists are changed.
Exercise
1. Try this problem when auxiliary space is not a constraint.
2. Try this problem when we don’t modify the actual list and create the resultant list.
