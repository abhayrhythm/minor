
Although C++ is designed to have backward compatibility with C there can be many C programs that would produce compiler error when compiled with a C++ compiler. Following are some of them.
1) In C++, it is a compiler error to call a function before it is declared.  But in C, it may compile (See http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-95/)

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   foo(); // foo() is called before its declaration/definition
} 

int foo()
{
   printf("Hello");
   return 0; 
}
