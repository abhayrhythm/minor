
Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. Width of a tree is maximum of widths of all levels.  
Let us consider the below example tree.

         1
        /  \
       2    3
     /  \     \
    4    5     8 
              /  \
             6    7

For the above tree,
width of level 1 is 1,
width of level 2 is 2,
width of level 3 is 3
width of level 4 is 2.  
So the maximum width of the tree is 3.
