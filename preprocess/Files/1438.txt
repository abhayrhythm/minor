We have discussed space efficient implementation of 2 stacks in a single array.  In this post, a general solution for k stacks is discussed.  Following is the detailed problem statement.
Create a data structure kStacks that represents k stacks. Implementation of kStacks should use only one array, i.e., k stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by kStacks.
push(int x, int sn) –> pushes x to stack number ‘sn’ where sn is from 0 to k-1
pop(int sn) –> pops an element from stack number ‘sn’ where sn is from 0 to k-1
