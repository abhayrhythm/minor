In C/C++, we can break a string at any point in the middle using two double quotes in the middle.  Below is a simple example to demonstrate the same. 

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   // We can put two double quotes anywhere in a string
   char *str1  = "geeks""quiz"; 

   // We can put space line break between two double quotes
   char *str2  = "Qeeks"     "Quiz";
   char *str3  = "Qeeks"     
                 "Quiz";

   puts(str1);
   puts(str2);
   puts(str3);

   puts("Geeks"        // Breaking string in multiple lines
        "forGeeks");
   return 0;
}

Output:
geeksquiz
GeeksQuiz
GeeksQuiz
GeeksforGeeks
Below are few examples with long long strings broken using two double quotes for better readability.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   char *str = "These are reserved words in C language are int, float, "
               "if, else, for, while etc. An Identifier is a sequence of"
               "letters and digits, but must start with a letter. "
               "Underscore ( _ ) is treated as a letter. Identifiers are "
               "case sensitive. Identifiers are used to name variables,"
               "functions etc.";
   puts(str);
   return 0; 
} 

Output: These are reserved words in C language are int, float, if, else, for, while etc. An Identifier is a sequence ofletters and digits, but must start with a letter. Underscore ( _ ) is treated as a letter. Identifiers are case sensitive. Identifiers are used to name variables,functions etc.
Similarly, we can write long strings in printf and or cout.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   char *str = "An Identifier is a sequence of"
               "letters and digits, but must start with a letter. "
               "Underscore ( _ ) is treated as a letter. Identifiers are "
               "case sensitive. Identifiers are used to name variables,"
               "functions etc.";
   printf ("These are reserved words in C language are int, float, "
            "if, else, for, while etc. %s ", str);
   return 0; 
} 
Output: These are reserved words in C language are int, float, if, else, for, while etc. An Identifier is a sequence ofletters and digits, but must start with a letter. Underscore ( _ ) is treated as a letter. Identifiers are case sensitive. Identifiers are used to name variables,functions etc.
