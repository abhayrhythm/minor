
You can win three kinds of basketball points, 1 point, 2 points, and 3 points. Given a total score n, print out all the combination to compose n. 
Examples:
For n = 1, the program should print following:
1
For n = 2, the program should print following:
1 1
2
For n = 3, the program should print following:
1 1 1
1 2
2 1
3
For n = 4, the program should print following:
1 1 1 1
1 1 2
1 2 1
1 3
2 1 1
2 2
3 1
and so on …
Algorithm:
At first position we can have three numbers 1 or 2 or 3.
First put 1 at first position and recursively call for n-1.
Then put 2 at first position and recursively call for n-2.
Then put 3 at first position and recursively call for n-3.
If n becomes 0 then we have formed a combination that compose n, so print the current combination.
Below is a generalized implementation. In the below implementation, we can change MAX_POINT if there are higher points (more than 3) in the basketball game. 

#define MAX_POINT 3
#define ARR_SIZE 100
#include<stdio.h>

/* Utility function to print array arr[] */
void printArray(int arr[], int arr_size);

/* The function prints all combinations of numbers 1, 2, ...MAX_POINT
   that sum up to n.
   i is used in recursion keep track of index in arr[] where next
   element is to be added. Initital value of i must be passed as 0 */
void printCompositions(int n, int i)
{

  /* array must be static as we want to keep track
   of values stored in arr[] using current calls of
   printCompositions() in function call stack*/
  static int arr[ARR_SIZE];

  if (n == 0)
  {
    printArray(arr, i);
  }
  else if(n > 0)
  {
    int k; 
    for (k = 1; k <= MAX_POINT; k++)
    {
      arr[i]= k;
      printCompositions(n-k, i+1);
    }
  }
}

/* UTILITY FUNCTIONS */
/* Utility function to print array arr[] */
void printArray(int arr[], int arr_size)
{
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < arr_size; i++)
    printf("%d ", arr[i]);
  printf("\n");
}

/* Driver function to test above functions */
int main()
{
  int n = 5;
  printf("Differnt compositions formed by 1, 2 and 3 of %d are\n", n);
  printCompositions(n, 0);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

Please write comments if you find any bug in above code/algorithm, or find other ways to solve the same problem.
