
What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that the data can be used efficiently. Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, B-trees are particularly well-suited for implementation of databases, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers. (Source: Wiki Page)
Which data structures are used for BFS and DFS of a graph?
Queue is used for BFS and Stack is used for DFS. DFS can also be implemented using recursion (Note that recursion also uses function call stack).
Can doubly linked be implemented using a single pointer variable in every node?
Doubly linked list can be implemented using a single pointer. See XOR Linked List – A Memory Efficient Doubly Linked List

How to check if a given Binary Tree is BST or not?
If inorder traversal of a binary tree is sorted, then the binary tree is BST. The idea is to simply do inorder traversal and while traversing keep track of previous key value. If current key value is greater, then continue, else return false. See A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not for more details.
