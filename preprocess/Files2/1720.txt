intuit behind push relabel algorithm consid fluid flow problem consid edg water pipe node joint 
sourc consid highest level send water adjac node 
node excess water push water smaller height node 
water get local trap vertex vertex relabel mean height increas 
follow use fact consid proceed algorithm 
vertex associ height variabl excess flow 
height use determin whether vertex push flow adjac vertex push flow smaller height vertex 
excess flow differ total flow come vertex minu total flow go vertex 
excess flow u total inflow u total outflow u like ford fulkerson 
edg associ flow indic current flow capac follow abstract step complet algorithm 
push relabel algorithm 1 initi preflow initi flow height 2 possibl perform push relablel vertex vertex excess flow push relabel point vertic excess flow 0 except sourc sink 3 return flow 
three main oper push relabel algorithm initi preflow initi height flow vertic 
preflow 1 initi height flow everi vertex 0 
2 initi height sourc vertex equal total number vertic graph

push use make flow node excess flow 
vertex excess flow adjac smaller height residu graph push flow vertex adjac lower height 
amount push flow pipe edg equal minimum excess flow capac edg 
relabel oper use vertex excess flow none adjac lower height 
basic increas height vertex perform push 
increas height pick minimum height adjac residu graph e adjac add flow add 1 
note oper perform residu graph like ford fulkerson 
illustr proceed exampl need make sure understand residu graph see detail residu graph 
residu graph differ graph shown
