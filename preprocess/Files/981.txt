
Write a C/C++ program that accepts a number from the user and prints “Even” if the entered number is even and prints “Odd” if the number is odd.  Your are not allowed to use any comparison (==, <, >..etc) or conditional (if, else, switch, ternary operator,..etc) statement.
Method 1
Below is a tricky code can be used to print “Even” or “Odd” accordingly.

#include<iostream>
#include<conio.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char arr[2][5] = {"Even", "Odd"};
  int no;
  cout << "Enter a number: ";
  cin >> no;
  cout << arr[no%2];
  getch();
  return 0;
}

Method 2
Below is another tricky code can be used to print “Even” or “Odd” accordingly.  Thanks to student for suggesting this method.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int no;
    printf("Enter a no: ");
    scanf("%d", &no);
    (no & 1 && printf("odd"))|| printf("even");
    return 0;
}

Please write comments if you find the above code incorrect, or find better ways to solve the same problem
