
Predict the output of below C programs. 
Question 1

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   int a;
   char *x;
   x = (char *) &a;
   a = 512;
   x[0] = 1;
   x[1] = 2;
   printf("%d\n",a);

   getchar();
   return 0;
} 

Answer: The output is dependent on endianness of a machine. Output is 513 in a little endian machine and 258 in a big endian machine.
Let integers are stored using 16 bits. In a little endian machine, when we do x[0] = 1 and x[1] = 2, the number a is changed to 00000001 00000010 which is representation of 513 in a little endian machine. The output would be same for 32 bit numbers also.
In a big endian machine, when we do x[0] = 1 and x[1] = 2, the number is changed to 00000001 00000010 which is representation of 258 in a big endian machine.
