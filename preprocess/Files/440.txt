
We have discussed Introduction to Binary Tree in set 1 and Properties of Binary Tree in Set 2.  In this post, common types of binary is discussed.
Following are common types of Binary Trees.
Full Binary Tree A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children.  Following are examples of full binary tree.

In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
       L = I + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes,   I = Number of internal nodes
See Handshaking Lemma and Tree for proof.
