
Given an unsorted array with repetitions, the task is to group multiple occurrence of individual elements.  The grouping should happen in a way that the order of first occurrences of all elements is maintained.
Examples:

Input: arr[] = {5, 3, 5, 1, 3, 3}
Output:        {5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 1}

Input: arr[] = {4, 6, 9, 2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 10, 4}
Output:        {4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9, 9, 2, 3, 10}
