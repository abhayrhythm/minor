
Re-arrangement questions are of two types : Sentence re-arrangement and passage re-arrangement.
In sentence re-arrangement, we are given a sentence whose words/group of words are jumbled and we have to make a meaningful sentence out of it.
In passage re-arrangement, we are given multiple sentences and we have to arrange them such that they make a meaningful paragraph.
Sample Problems
Question 1 : Re-arrange the parts of the sentence so as to make a meaningful sentence.
The prime minister / with the guards / along / has arrived
Solution : The prime minister along with the guards has arrived
 
Question 2 : Re-arrange the parts of the paragraph so as to make a meaningful passage.
a) Infact, his belief was that customers are the origin, the source of money any company has.
b) The owner of Walmart, Sam Walton, built his empire on one principle – Customer is the God.
c) So it is not the company which pays, the customer does.
d) The customer thus has the right to fire anybody in the company, from a salesman to the chairman.
