
What code to write in place of “// your code”  so that the below code prints 20.

#include <stdio.h>
int f();

int main()
{
    int a = 0;
    f();
    printf("%d",a);
    return 0;
}

int f()
{
   // your code
}
Output:

20

This question seems to be a trick question, as it is not possible to update local variable in a function without sending it, we can’t make value of ‘a’ as 20 but for outputting 20 we can write function f as below – 

#include <stdio.h>
int f();

int main()
{
    int a = 0;
    f();
    printf("%d",a);
    return 0;
}
 
int f()
{
    printf("2");
}
2 will be printed by f() and 0 will be printed by a
Thanks to Utkarsh Trivedi for suggesting above solution.
