Question 1

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;
  if (c > b > a)
  {
    printf("TRUE");
  }
  else
  {
    printf("FALSE");
  }
  getchar();
  return 0;
}
Output: FALSE
Let us consider the condition inside the if statement. Since there are two greater than (>) operators in expression “c > b > a”, associativity of > is considered. Associativity of > is left to right. So, expression c > b > a is evaluated as ( (c > b) > a ) which is false.
