
Newspapers and magazines often have crypt-arithmetic puzzles of the form: 

  SEND
+ MORE
--------
 MONEY
-------- 
 
The goal here is to assign each letter a digit from 0 to 9 so that the arithmetic works out correctly. The rules are that all occurrences of a letter must be assigned the same digit, and no digit can be assigned to more than one letter.

First, create a list of all the characters that need assigning to pass to Solve 
If all characters are assigned, return true if puzzle is solved, false otherwise
Otherwise, consider the first unassigned character 
for (every possible choice among the digits not in use) 
        make that choice and then recursively try to assign the rest of the characters
        if recursion sucessful, return true
    if !successful, unmake assignment and try another digit
