Question 1

/* Assume that n is greater than or equal to 1 */
int fun1(int n)
{
  if(n == 1)
     return 0;
  else
     return 1 + fun1(n/2);
} 

Answer: The function calculates and returns .  For example, if n is between 8 and 15 then fun1() returns 3. If n is between 16 to 31 then fun1() returns 4.
