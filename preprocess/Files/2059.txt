
In C and C++, comma is the last operator in precedence table. So comma should be carefully used on right side of an assignment expression.  For example, one might expect the output as b = 10 in below program. But program prints b = 20 as assignment has higher precedence over comma and the statement “b = 20, a” becomes equivalent to “(b = 20), a”. 

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a = 10, b;
  b = 20, a;   // b = 20
  printf(" b = %d ", b);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

Putting a bracket with comma makes b = a (or 10).

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a = 10, b;
  b = (20, a); // b = a
  printf(" b = %d ", b);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}
