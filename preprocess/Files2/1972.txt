predict output follow c program includ iostream use namespac std class public cout constructor call endl class b static public b cout b constructor call endl int main b b return 0 output b constructor call program call b constructor call constructor 
reason simpl static member declar class declar defin 
must explicitli defin outsid class use scope resolut oper 
tri access static member without explicit definit get compil error 
exampl follow program fail compil 
includ iostream use namespac std class int x public cout constructor call endl class b static public b cout b constructor call endl static geta return int main b b b geta return 0 output compil error undefin refer b add definit program work fine call constructor 
see follow program 
includ iostream use namespac std class int x public cout constructor call endl class b static public b cout b constructor call endl static geta return b definit int main b b1 b2 b3 b1 geta return 0 output constructor call b constructor call b constructor call b constructor call note program call b constructor 3 time 3 object b1 b2 b3 call constructor 
reason static member share among object 
also known class member class field 
also static member access without object see program static member access without object 
includ iostream use namespac std class int x public cout constructor call endl class b static public b cout b constructor call endl static geta return b definit int main static member access without object b b geta return 0 output constructor call pleas write comment find anyth incorrect want share inform topic discuss adsbygoogl window adsbygoogl push compani wise code practic topic wise code practic
