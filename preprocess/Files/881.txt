
All of these functions read a character from input and return an integer value.  The integer is returned to accommodate a special value used to indicate failure.  The value EOF is generally used for this purpose.
getc():
It reads a single character from a given input stream and returns the corresponding integer value (typically ASCII value of read character) on success. It returns EOF on failure.
Syntax:
int getc(FILE *stream); 
Example:

// Example for getc() in C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("%c", getc(stdin));
   return(0);
}


Input: g (press enter key)
Output: g 
getchar():
The difference between getc() and getchar() is getc() can read from any input stream, but getchar() reads from standard input.  So getchar() is equivalent to getc(stdin).  
Syntax:
int getchar(void); 
Example:

// Example for getchar() in C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("%c", getchar());
   return 0;
}


Input: g(press enter key)
Output: g 
getch():
getch() is a nonstandard function and is present in conio.h header file which is mostly used by MS-DOS compilers like Turbo C. It is not part of the C standard library or ISO C, nor is it defined by POSIX (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conio.h)
Like above functions, it reads also a single character from keyboard. But it does not use any buffer, so the entered character is immediately returned without waiting for the enter key.
Syntax:
int getch();
Example:

// Example for getch() in C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("%c", getch());   
   return 0;
}

Input:  g (Without enter key)
Output: Program terminates immediately.
        But when you use DOS shell in Turbo C, 
        it shows a single g, i.e., 'g'
getche()
Like getch(), this is also a non-standard function present in conio.h.  It reads a single character from the keyboard and displays immediately on output screen without waiting for enter key.
Syntax:
int getche(void); 
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
// Example for getche() in C
int main()
{
  printf("%c", getche());
  return 0;
}

Input: g(without enter key as it is not buffered)
Output: Program terminates immediately.
        But when you use DOS shell in Turbo C, 
        double g, i.e., 'gg'
