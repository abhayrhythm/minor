
In C, we cannot access a global variable if we have a local variable with same name, but it is possible in C++ using scope resolution operator (::). 

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int x;  // Global x

int main()
{
  int x = 10; // Local x
  cout<<"Value of global x is "<<::x<<endl;
  cout<<"Value of local x is "<<x;  
  getchar();
  return 0;
}
