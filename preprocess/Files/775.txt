
In data sufficiency questions, we are given a question and a set of statements. We have to find which of the given statements is required to reach the conclusion.
Sample Problems
Question 1 : Question – Who is the tallest among the brothers A, B, C, D ?
Statement 1 : C is shorter than only B
Statement 2 : D is taller than only A
I) Statement 1 alone is sufficient
II) Statement 2 alone is sufficient
III) Both statement 1 and statement 2 together are sufficient
IV) Both statement 1 and statement 2 even together are not sufficient
Solution : If we consider statement 1 only, we can safely conclude that B is the tallest of all.
If we consider statement 2 only, we can safely conclude that A is the shortest of all.
Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.
 
Question 2 : What is the value of ‘x’
Statement 1 : x2 + x – 6 = 0
Statement 2 : x ≥ 0
I) Statement 1 alone is sufficient
II) Statement 2 alone is sufficient
III) Both statement 1 and statement 2 together are sufficient
IV) Both statement 1 and statement 2 even together are not sufficient
Solution : If we consider statement 1 alone, we have
x2 + x – 6 = 0
=> x2 + 6 x – x – 6 = 0
=> (x + 6) (x – 1) = 0
=> x = -6, 1
If we consider statement 2 alone, we have x ≥ 0
Combining the two statements, we can safely say that x = 1
Therefore, both statement 1 and statement 2 together are sufficient but neither alone is sufficient.
