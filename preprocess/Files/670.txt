Round 1: Technical Test
An online test held on HackerRank which consists of 20 MCQ’s and 2 coding questions.

Coding Question 1: Find a tour that visits all the stations

In both the questions brute force solutions were accepted, i.e O(n^2).

MCQ’s

We were told that there will be only 2 Technical Rounds and No HR round.
Face to Face Round 1: (~1 hour)
