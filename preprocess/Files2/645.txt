n n 1 0 true fals 5 given array number repeat one non repeat find non repeat number 
gave algorithm use xor 
6 extend previou question find two number non repeat 
want xor approach 
7 given two binari tree b check b subtre solv use nomal tree travers 
8 find kth smallest element unsort array number 
first gave approach use heap 
put element array min heap extract k time 
interest better approach 
answer use quick select algorithm modifi quick sort 
told optim approach select pivot element use order statist 
knew order statist method quit satisfi basic quick select algorithm 
round 4 director round 1 brief introduct
