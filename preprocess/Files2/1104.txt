c implement simpl method find minimum differ pair includ bit stdc h use namespac std return minimum differ pair int findmindiff int arr int n initi differ infinit int diff int_max find min diff compar differ possibl pair given array int 0 n 1 int j 1 j n j ab arr arr j diff diff ab arr arr j return min diff return diff driver code int main int arr 1 5 3 19 18 25 int n sizeof arr sizeof arr 0 cout minimum differ findmindiff arr n return 0 output minimum differ 1 method 2 effici n log n idea use sort 
step 
1 sort array ascend order 
step take n log n time 
2 initi differ infinit 
step take 1 time 
3 compar adjac pair sort array keep track minimum differ 
step take n time
