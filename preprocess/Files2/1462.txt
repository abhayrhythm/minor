suppos circl 
n petrol pump circl 
given two set data 
1 amount petrol everi petrol pump 
2 distanc petrol pump next petrol pump 
calcul first point truck abl complet circl truck stop petrol pump infinit capac 
expect time complex n 
assum 1 litr petrol truck go 1 unit distanc 
exampl let 4 petrol pump amount petrol distanc next petrol pump valu pair 4 6 6 5 7 3 4 5 
first point truck make circular tour 2nd petrol pump 
output start 1 index 2nd petrol pump 
simpl solut consid everi petrol pump start point see possibl tour 
find start point feasibl solut return start point 
worst case time complex solut n 2 
use queue store current tour 
first enqueu first petrol pump queue keep enqueu petrol pump till either complet tour current amount petrol becom neg 
amount becom neg keep dequeu petrol pump till current amount becom posit queue becom empti 
instead creat separ queue use given array queue 
maintain two index variabl start end repres rear front queue
