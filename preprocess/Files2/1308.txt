tic tac toe board given move play 
find given board valid e possibl reach board posit move 
note everi arbitrari fill grid 9 space valid e g 
grid fill 3 x 6 valid situat player need take altern turn 
input given 1d array size 9 input board x x x x x output valid input board x x x x x output invalid x cannot win input board x output valid valid board two move play strongli recommend click practic move solut 
basic find valid input grid think condit input grid invalid 
let 
x countx 
counto 
sinc know game start x given grid tic tac toe game would definit invalid follow two condit meet countx counto b countx counto 1 sinc x alway first move second condit also requir 
mean remain board posit valid one 
answer 
think case input grid x make straight line 
also valid posit game end one player win 
need check follow condit well c input grid show player win situat invalid posit 
input grid show player put straight line e 
win condit countx counto invalid posit 
reason play move x play move 
sinc x start game would win x play equal 
move 
e input grid show x win condit xcount must one greater ocount 
arm condit e 
b c easili formul algorithm program check valid given tic tac toe board posit 
1 countx counto countx counto 1 2 win condit check x also win valid b xbox obox valid 3 x win condit check xcount one ocount anoth way find valid given board use invers method e 
rule possibl given board invalid
